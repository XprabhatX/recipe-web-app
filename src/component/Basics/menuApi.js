        "A quick and delicious instant noodle dish that is perfect for a busy morning breakfast.",
      recipe:
        `Maggi is a popular instant noodle dish that is easy to make and can be a quick breakfast option. However, it's not always the healthiest option. Here's a recipe for a healthier version of Maggi that you can make for breakfast:

        Ingredients:
        
        1 pack of whole wheat Maggi noodles
        1 cup of mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, bell peppers)
        1/2 cup of diced tomatoes
        1/4 cup of diced onions
        2 cloves of minced garlic
        1 teaspoon of olive oil
        1/4 teaspoon of black pepper
        Salt to taste
        1 cup of water

        Instructions:
        
        Start by heating the olive oil in a pan over medium heat.
        Add the diced onions and minced garlic and sauté until they are translucent.
        Add the mixed vegetables and sauté for 2-3 minutes.
        Add the diced tomatoes and sauté for another 2-3 minutes.
        Add the water, black pepper, and salt to the pan and bring the mixture to a boil.
        Break the Maggi noodles into small pieces and add them to the pan.
        Stir the noodles and vegetables well and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the noodles are soft.
        Serve the Maggi in a bowl and enjoy your healthy breakfast.
        You can add egg or chicken/paneer to make it more nutritious.
        
        Note: This recipe is a healthier alternative to the traditional Maggi, but it's still important to consume instant noodles in moderation as they are high in sodium and MSG.`,

        In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, yeast, honey and salt.
